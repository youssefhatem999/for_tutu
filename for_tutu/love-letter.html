            <p>Happy happy happy anniversary my Mersiha, another year together and another day to remember how lucky i am to have you. You're my gift from Allah and I'll forever be the luckiest man alive to have you.</p>
            <p>Today is our special day, the day that is ours and no body else's, the day we finally got together, and became boyfriend and girlfriend. Every moment from that night on the bus until this moment as your beautiful eyes are reading this has been the best time of my life. My love for you only got stronger and stronger every moment since then.</p>
            <p>We went through a lot together, some good and some bad, but we always got back together, we always got closer to each other, and we always became better than before. I love you so much my Mersiha. My tutu. My baby. My wifey. My smoly. Being with you is my goal in life, being your man, and seeing you fulfilled and happy is my real dream in this world.</p>
            <p>You're my sunshine, my backbone, my one and only, you've always been there for me even if I didn't ask for it, you're my perfect baby girl. I love you so muchie muchie muchie muchie muchie muchie muchie muchie muchie, always and forever.</p>
            <p>Texting you as i wake up, as I work, as i do this or that, on the bus, sneakily while spending time with the family, i love spending every moment i can with you, and i can't wait till we can spend every single moment of our lives together, and be together IRL, and get married and life a beautiful life together InShaAllah.</p>
            <p>I love you so much my Mersiha. I wish I could take you out tonight and have a special anniversary date, but InShaAllah we will have many dates and many many celebrations and happy times together forever my love. You're my one and only, my perfect princess, my tutu, my cutey patootey, you're my love, my heart and my soul, and my everything.</p>
            <p>I wish i could make a better, bigger, crazier gift that can show how much I love you, but this is what I was able to craft with love for now, i had a smile on my face for every moment while working on this, and i hope this will make you smile too.</p>
            <p>To all the many years to come InShaAllah, while we both have our lives figured, doing jobs we love, living together, going through everything together, being happy together, no more stresses or worries. I can't wait for those times with you my love.</p>
            <p>I love you so much my Mersiha, my wifey, my perfect baby girl, and i hope you enjoy this little gift. Happy anniversary my love.</p>
